Project Overview
This project is a group effort by five members to analyze Airbnb price trends using data sourced from Kaggle. The objective is to provide strategic insights into Airbnb listings by examining various metrics such as pricing, location trends, and host performance. The final output is a dashboard created in Power BI, which offers a comprehensive view of Airbnb's key metrics for informed decision-making.

Data Source
Dataset: The dataset was obtained from Kaggle, containing detailed information on Airbnb listings, including prices, locations, room types, host details, and additional listing features.
Project Workflow
1. Data Acquisition
The dataset was downloaded from Kaggle and stored in Google Drive for accessible cloud storage.
2. Data Processing in Python
Python Libraries Used: pandas, pydrive.
Performed data cleaning, including handling missing values, converting data types, and filtering relevant records.
3. Database Connection (MySQL)
Established a connection to a local MySQL server using mysql.connector and sqlalchemy.
Created a database and table to store the cleaned data, facilitating analysis and efficient data management.
4. Visualization with Power BI
Connected the processed data from MySQL to Power BI.
Designed an interactive dashboard to display key insights such as:
Price distributions
Room type comparisons
Location-based analysis
Superhost versus host metrics
Business booking insights by city
Features and Functionality
Dynamic City Selection: Analyze data for various cities (e.g., Amsterdam, Athens, London) to understand local Airbnb trends.
Key Metrics Display: Metrics such as average price per night, total revenue, guest satisfaction ratings, and business listing counts.
Visualizations: Comprehensive visualizations including:
Room type distribution and price trends
City-specific price variations and room type availability
Superhost comparisons by city
Distribution of bookings for business purposes by city
Technologies Used
